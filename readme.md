# Introduction
This repo houses a two-notebook project on novels obtained from Project Gutenberg. In this project, I compare modeling and clustering for text classification and conclude that modeling is superior to clustering for this task. [Part 1](https://github.com/michellekli/love-stories/blob/master/love-stories-part1.ipynb) covers data cleaning. [Part 2](https://github.com/michellekli/love-stories/blob/master/love-stories-part2.ipynb) covers feature creation, model evaluation, and clustering evaluation.

# Results
## Multinomial Naive Bayes achieves 90.8% accuracy, which is ~40% higher than spectral clustering.

## Spectral clustering correctly classifies some authors more than others.

## Observations with higher prediction stability are more likely to be correctly classified.
