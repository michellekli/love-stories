    "# Introduction¶\n",
    "In this project, I compare modeling and clustering for text classification and conclude that modeling is superior to clustering for this task. This notebook is part 1 of a two-notebook project on novels obtained from Project Gutenberg, and in this notebook I perform data cleaning on the dataset. [Part 2](https://github.com/michellekli/thinkful/blob/master/bootcamp/love-stories-part2.ipynb) covers feature creation, model evaluation, and clustering evaluation.\n",

    "# Data Set\n",
    "The data set consists of 10 novels downloaded from Project Gutenberg. They were all found within the first few pages of the [\"Books about Love stories (sorted by popularity)\"](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/subject/2487) list.\n",

Her husband's family had been residents there for generations,\\r\\nand bore, indeed, the name of their birthplace--Bretton of Bretton:\\r\\nwhether by coincidence, or because some remote ancestor had been a\\r\\npersonage of sufficient importance to leave his name to his\\r\\nneighbourhood, I know not.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I was a girl I went to Bretton about twice a year, and well I\\r\\nliked the visit. The house and its inmates specially suited me. The\\r\\nlarge peaceful rooms, the well-arranged furniture, the clear wide\\r\\nwindows, the balcony outside, looking down on a fine antique street,\\r\\nwhere Sundays and holidays seemed always to abide--so quiet was its\\r\\natmosphere, so clean its pavement--these things pleased me well.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne child in a household of grown people is usually made very much of,\\r\\nand in a quiet way I was a good deal taken notice of by Mrs. Bretton,\\r\\nwho had been left a widow, with one son, before I knew her; her\\r\\nhusband, a physician, having died while she was yet a young and\\r\\nhandsome woman.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was not young, as I remember her, but she was still handsome, tall,\\r\\nwell-made, and though dark for an Englishwoman, yet wearing always the\\r\\nclearness of health in her brunette cheek, and its vivacity in a pair\\r\\nof fine, cheerful black eyes. People esteemed it a grievous pity that\\r\\nshe had not conferred her complexion on her son, whose eyes were\\r\\nblue--though, even in boyhood, very piercing--and the colour of his\\r\\nlong hair such as friends did not venture to specify, except as the sun\\r\\nshone on it, when they called it golden. He inherited the lines of his\\r\\nmother's features, however; also her good teeth, her stature (or the\\r\\npromise of her stature, for he was not yet full-grown), and, what was\\r\\nbetter, her health without flaw, and her spirits of that tone and\\r\\nequality which are better than a fortune to the possessor.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the autumn of the year ---- I was staying at Bretton; m\""

       "\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy godmother lived in a handsome house in the clean and ancient town of\\r\\nBretton. Her husband's family had been residents there for generations,\\r\\nand bore, indeed, the name of their birthplace--Bretton of Bretton:\\r\\nwhether by coincidence, or because some remote ancestor had been a\\r\\npersonage of sufficient importance to leave his name to his\\r\\nneighbourhood, I know not.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I was a girl I went to Bretton about twice a year, and well I\\r\\nliked the visit. The house and its inmates specially suited me. The\\r\\nlarge peaceful rooms, the well-arranged furniture, the clear wide\\r\\nwindows, the balcony outside, looking down on a fine antique street,\\r\\nwhere Sundays and holidays seemed always to abide--so quiet was its\\r\\natmosphere, so clean its pavement--these things pleased me well.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne child in a household of grown people is usually made very much of,\\r\\nand in a quiet way I was a good deal taken notice of by Mrs. Bretton,\\r\\nwho had been left a widow, with one son, before I knew her; her\\r\\nhusband, a physician, having died while she was yet a young and\\r\\nhandsome woman.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was not young, as I remember her, but she was still handsome, tall,\\r\\nwell-made, and though dark for an Englishwoman, yet wearing always the\\r\\nclearness of health in her brunette cheek, and its vivacity in a pair\\r\\nof fine, cheerful black eyes. People esteemed it a grievous pity that\\r\\nshe had not conferred her complexion on her son, whose eyes were\\r\\nblue--though, even in boyhood, very piercing--and the colour of his\\r\\nlong hair such as friends did not venture to specify, except as the sun\\r\\nshone on it, when they called it golden. He inherited the lines of his\\r\\nmother's features, however; also her good teeth, her stature (or the\\r\\npromise of her stature, for he was not yet full-grown), and, what was\\r\\nbetter, her health without flaw, and her spirits of that tone and\\r\\nequality which are better than a fortune to the possessor.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the autumn of the year ---- I was staying at Bretton; my godmother\\r\\nhaving come\""

Young women of such birth, living in a\\r\\nquiet country-house, and attending a village church hardly larger than\\r\\na parlor, naturally regarded frippery as the ambition of a huckster\\'s\\r\\ndaughter.

Like “Roderick”\\r\\n and like “_The American_,” it had been designed for publication in “_The\\r\\nAtlantic Monthly_,” where it began to appear in 1880. It differed from\\r\\nits two predecessors, however, in finding a course also open to it, from\\r\\nmonth to month, in “_Macmillan’s Magazine_”; which was to be for me one of\\r\\nthe last occasions of simultaneous “serialisation” in the two countries\\r\\nthat the changing conditions of literary intercourse between England and\\r\\nthe United States had up to then left unaltered. It is a long novel, and\\r\\nI was long in writing it; I remember being again much occupied with it,\\r\\nthe following year, during a stay of several weeks made in Venice. I had\\r\\nrooms on Riva Schiavoni, at the top of a house near the passage leading\\r\\noff to San Zaccaria; the waterside life, the wondrous lagoon spread\\r\\nbefore me, and the ceaseless human chatter of Venice came in at my\\r\\nwindows, to which I seem to myself to have been constantly driven, in\\r\\nthe fruitless fidget of composition, as if to see whether, out in the\\r\\nblue channel, the ship of some right suggestion, of some better phrase'"

Have a little compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.” “Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she times them ill.” “I do not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty fretfully. “When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?” “To-morrow fortnight.” “Aye, so it is,” cried her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come back till the day before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know him herself.” “Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce Mr. Bingley to _her_.” “Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teasing?” “I honour your circumspection.

It was a wet night; the rain lashed the panes, and the wind sounded angry and restless. \"Poor child!\" said Mrs. Bretton from time to time. \"What weather for her journey! I wish she were safe here.\" A little before ten the door-bell announced Warren's return. No sooner was the door opened than I ran down into the hall; there lay a trunk and some band-boxes, beside them stood a person like a nurse-girl, and at the foot of the staircase was Warren with a shawled bundle in his arms. \"Is that the child?\" I asked. \"Yes, miss.\" I would have opened the shawl, and tried to get a peep at the face, but it was hastily turned from me to Warren's shoulder. \"Put me down, please,\" said a small voice when Warren opened the drawing-room door, \"and take off this shawl,\" continued the speaker, extracting with its minute hand the pin, and with a sort of fastidious haste doffing the clumsy wrapping.

I had seen him risk his limbs blindly at a fox-hunt and in a cricket-field; and soon afterwards I saw him risk his life, just as blindly, in the sea at Brighton. We had met there accidentally, and were bathing together. If we had been engaged in any exercise peculiar to my own nation I should, of course, have looked after Pesca carefully; but as foreigners are generally quite as well able to take care of themselves in the water as Englishmen, it never occurred to me that the art of swimming might merely add one more to the list of manly exercises which the Professor believed that he could learn impromptu. Soon after we had both struck out from shore, I stopped, finding my friend did not gain on me, and turned round to look for him. To my horror and amazement, I saw nothing between me and the beach but two little white arms which struggled for an instant above the surface of the water, and then disappeared from view.

      "opinion about the new young ladies, even among the cottagers, was generally in favor of Celia, as being so amiable and innocent-looking, while Miss Brooke's large eyes seemed, like her religion, too unusual and striking. Poor Dorothea! compared with her, the innocent-looking Celia was knowing and worldly-wise; so much subtler is a human mind than the outside tissues which make a sort of blazonry or clock-face for it. Yet those who approached Dorothea, though prejudiced against her by this alarming hearsay, found that she had a charm unaccountably reconcilable with it. Most men thought her bewitching when she was on horseback. She loved the fresh air and the various aspects of the country, and when her eyes and cheeks glowed with mingled pleasure she looked very little like a devotee. Riding was an indulgence which she allowed herself in spite of conscientious qualms; she felt that she enjoyed it in a pagan sensuous way, and always looked forward to renouncing it. She was open, ardent, and not in the least self-admiring; indeed, it was pretty to see how her imagination adorned her sister Celia with attractions altogether superior to her own, and if any gentleman appeared to come to the Grange from some other motive than that of seeing Mr. Brooke, she concluded\n",

Lord Cumnor had certainly a little time for gossip, which he contrived to combine with the failing of personal intervention between the old land-steward and the tenantry. But, then, the countess made up by her unapproachable dignity for this weakness of the earl's. Once a year she was condescending. She and the ladies, her daughters, had set up a school; not a school after the manner of schools now-a-days, where far better intellectual teaching is given to the boys and girls of labourers and work-people than often falls to the lot of their betters in worldly estate; but a school of the kind we should call \"industrial,\" where girls are taught to sew beautifully, to be capital housemaids, and pretty fair cooks, and, above all, to dress neatly in a kind of charity uniform devised by the ladies of Cumnor Towers; white caps, white tippets, check aprons, blue gowns, and ready curtseys, and \"please, ma'ams,\" being _de rigueur_. Now, as the countess was absent from the Towers for a considerable part of the year, she was glad to enlist the sympathy of the Hollingford ladies in this school, with a view to obtaining their aid as visitors during the\n",

The boy quickly waved a signal of assent, drew the water with what was a great effort for one of his stature, landed and emptied the big bucket into his own pair of smaller ones, and pausing a moment for breath, started with them across the patch of clammy greensward whereon the well stood nearly in the centre of the little village, or rather hamlet of Marygreen. It was as old-fashioned as it was small, and it rested in the lap of an undulating upland adjoining the North Wessex downs. Old as it was, however, the well-shaft was probably the only relic of the local history that remained absolutely unchanged. Many of the thatched and dormered dwelling-houses had been pulled down of late years, and many trees felled on the green. Above all, the original church, hump-backed, wood-turreted, and quaintly hipped, had been taken down, and either cracked up into heaps of road-metal in the lane, or utilized as pig-sty walls, garden seats, guard-stones to fences, and rockeries in the flower-beds of the neighbourhood.

A beautiful collie dog lay upon the grass near his chair, watching the master’s face almost as tenderly as the master took in the still more magisterial physiognomy of the house; and a little bristling, bustling terrier bestowed a desultory attendance upon the other gentlemen. One of these was a remarkably well-made man of five-and-thirty, with a face as English as that of the old gentleman I have just sketched was something else; a noticeably handsome face, fresh-coloured, fair and frank, with firm, straight features, a lively grey eye and the rich adornment of a chestnut beard. This person had a certain fortunate, brilliant exceptional look the air of a happy temperament fertilised by a high civilisation which would have made almost any observer envy him at a venture. He was booted and spurred, as if he had dismounted from a long ride; he wore a white hat, which looked too large for him; he held his two hands behind him, and in one of them a large, white, well-shaped fist was crumpled a pair of soiled dog-skin gloves.

Be that as it may, in those early days when he brought his wife to her new home, his window on the Manchester side was a foam and a may-blossom of muslins and prints, his window on the London side was an autumn evening of silks and rich fabrics. What wife could fail to be dazzled! But she, poor darling, from her stone hall in stony Derbyshire, was a little bit repulsed by the man's dancing in front of his stock, like David before the ark. The home to which he brought her was a monument. In the great bedroom over the shop he had his furniture _built_: built of solid mahogany: oh too, too solid. No doubt he hopped or skipped himself with satisfaction into the monstrous matrimonial bed: it could only be mounted by means of a stool and chair. But the poor, secluded little woman, older than he, must have climbed up with a heavy heart, to lie and face the gloomy Bastille of mahogany, the great cupboard opposite, or to turn wearily sideways to the great cheval mirror, which performed a perpetual and hideous bow before her grace.

It was only that afternoon that May Welland had let him guess that she \"cared\" (New York's consecrated phrase of maiden avowal), and already his imagination, leaping ahead of the engagement ring, the betrothal kiss and the march from Lohengrin, pictured her at his side in some scene of old European witchery.

Moreover, her husband walking with a quick rhythmic stride, jerking his free hand occasionally, was either a Viking or a stricken Nelson; the sea-gulls had changed his note. \"Ridley, shall we drive? Shall we drive, Ridley?\" Mrs. Ambrose had to speak sharply; by this time he was far away. The cab, by trotting steadily along the same road, soon withdrew them from the West End, and plunged them into London. It appeared that this was a great manufacturing place, where the people were engaged in making things, as though the West End, with its electric lamps, its vast plate-glass windows all shining yellow, its carefully-finished houses, and tiny live figures trotting on the pavement, or bowled along on wheels in the road, was the finished work. It appeared to her a very small bit of work for such an enormous factory to have made. For some reason it\n"
